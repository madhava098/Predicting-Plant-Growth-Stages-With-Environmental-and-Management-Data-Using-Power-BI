# Predicting-Plant-Growth-Stages-With-Environmental-and-Management-Data-Using-Power-BI
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing plant growth stages using environmental and management data. The dataset includes factors such as soil type, sunlight hours, water frequency, fertilizer type, temperature, and humidity, which influence plant growth milestones. By leveraging Power BI, we created an interactive dashboard that provides insights into plant growth patterns, environmental conditions, and best practices for optimal growth.

🎯 Objectives

🔹 Understand how environmental factors impact plant growth.

🔹 Identify optimal temperature, humidity, and watering frequency for healthy plant development.

🔹 Visualize key metrics using dynamic charts and graphs.

🔹 Provide actionable insights for farmers, researchers, and agricultural analysts.

📊 Data Processing & Preparation

1️⃣ Data Collection: Imported dataset containing environmental and management factors.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and formatted data.

3️⃣ New Columns Created:

Water_Frequency_Numeric (converted categorical values to numerical).

Temperature & Humidity Ranges (grouped values into meaningful categories).

Growth Milestone Description & Plant Growth Category (classified plant growth).

4️⃣ Measures Added:

Average Temperature, Humidity, and Sunlight.

Growth Milestone Measure, Percentage, and Count.

📊 Key Visualizations & Insights

✅ Pie Chart – Proportion of Average Sunlight Hours by Soil Type.

✅ Donut Chart – Distribution of Growth Milestone by Soil Type.

✅ Stacked Column Chart – Comparison of Average Temperature by Temperature Range.

✅ Decomposition Tree – Impact analysis of Growth Milestone by Soil Type.

✅ Gauge Chart – Monitoring Growth Milestone Measure (Count).

✅ Treemap – Distribution of Plant Growth Milestones by Water Frequency.

✅ Area Chart – Tracking Average Humidity by Humidity Range.

✅ Stacked Bar Chart – Comparison of Average Temperature by Temperature Range.

✅ Cards – Displaying summary metrics like Average Temperature, Humidity, and Sunlight.

📊 Interactive Dashboard

🎯 Designed a user-friendly and responsive dashboard with:

✔ Dynamic filters for soil type, temperature, humidity, and fertilizer type.

✔ Drill-through capabilities for deeper analysis.

✔ Visually appealing and easy-to-interpret charts.

🛠️ Technologies Used

✅ Excel/CSV – Used as the dataset source.

✅ Power Query – For data cleaning and transformation.

✅ DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For creating calculated measures and aggregations.

✅ Power BI – For data visualization and dashboard creation.

🚀 Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into plant growth stages based on environmental and management conditions. By using Power BI, we built an interactive, data-driven dashboard that helps in understanding optimal conditions for plant growth, leading to better agricultural decisions.
